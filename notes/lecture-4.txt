lecture 4 05-10-2021 - Decisions and storyboard


Feedback and recap:
	frontend vs backend
		stop complaining, good backend is useless without good frontend
		design process stops confusion - if you only talk about things people
		have different ideas about how the product looks like
	End product will probably end up not that pretty
	Remember to send the results for the day to Henrik

Present eachothers ideas
	Let facilitator present - avoids the most well spoken/captivating person
	to push through and convince people
	If the facilitator doesnt present let 1-2 other people do it

Decisions
	Democracy is great, but not in a sprint - the decider decides
		If not the decision will porperly be changed later
	The decide decides the final solution
	If no natural decider - roll a dice twice to select 2
		Pick ideas that maybe cant co-exist so you get a rumble later

A good designer not someone who is good at designing, but someone who is good at
coming to a design.

Rumble
	Several prototypes are built to let different user variables
	Lets you pick best solution
	The purpose of this is to let more people of the team work on the things
	The purpose of testing is not to decide features, but to verify ideas
	and use cases
	

Storyboard
	Divide a board into 15 slides
	Story = specify the user journey
	Start with the first square
		Start outside the product
			If an app start in app store
			if a website start at a websearch
	The last square = what the user is trying to accomplish
		If a shop end with "your order is on the way"
		If it is a game end with "you won" or "game over"
	Can be 10 of the same "screen" but just where they do different things
	Login system
		Credibility
			If low credibility (game platform) use other logins like
			facebook or google gmail
			If high you can use a traditional login system
	You can make the storyboard event driven
		If you clik on one thing you go one way and if you click on
		another thing you go some other way
		Just make sure that you dont branch into two branches
			Make sure they reconnect FAST
	If you split up
		one deicer in each group
		one storyboard per group
	When done
		see if there is overlap
		Two ways:
			does it make sense to make two prototypes
			good indicator is if someone disagress -> make two
			protoypes

Make things in different complexities
	Make it hard to get to the complex functionality
		Makes sure that advanced user have the functionality
		Makes sure the novice users dont accidently encounter advanced
		usage		

Naming
	Take 5 mintues to write names on post-its
		if it is stupid then write it anyway
		select names after
	Make sure they sound the same
	First impression is important
