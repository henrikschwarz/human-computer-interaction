User journey should be user focused on the user, not on your business case

Risks:
	Not done in time
		Weight feature cost/profit
		Cost of delay
	Not being able to acquire printers
	Fee is too high
	Transaction is not secure
		Maybe add the product as a thing in the transaction
		Maybe go more in depth with transaction process

Sketching
	Sketches are not meant to be pretty
	your sketches matter
		even the simplest sketch can kick start your process
	ALWAYS sketch on paper
		The person with the fanciest drawing tool (like a tablet)
		becomes automatically an authority in the design process which
		we dont want.

Lightning demos
	The process
		Make a list of demo system candidates
		Select 1-2 subsystems write them on a whiteboard
		Give a 3 minute demo
		Draw the best ideas
			new component new paper
			new idea new paper
			Make sure the demo the presenter is most important
			excited about is drawn
	Divide or swarm
		Divide into groups
		If eveyone is focused on same idea: Swarm
	Notes
		Take some time (maybe 20 min) and look at what you have made
		Start the thinking process
	Ideas
		Spend 20 minutes roughing out ideas

Crazy 8s
	Fold paper into 8 sections
	Draw 8 sketches in 8 minutes
	Some ideas suck - draw them anyway
		So you dont get stuck on a bad idea
	Forces you to think fast
	Hernik comment: The first drawing almost never ends in the end product
		So draw alot

	Solution sketch
		Select your best idea
		IF multiple steps : draw them

Present sketches
	Book recommends anonymous sketches - Henrik disagrees
		Engineers present ideas
	Sometimes you have someone who is more convincing than others
		IF that is the case then you need to even it out.
		If it is yourself (like Henrik) then be concious about it and
		talk your ideas alittle down so others also get involved
	Iterate
		Make a second iteration after you saw the first sketches
		Should be faster than first round of sketches
		Only do one more iteration
If you make designs:
	User input fields (like username and password) should auto fill
	themselves.

Portfolio:
	A slide shpw you update every week
	Is gonna be used for the exam at the end of the semester.
